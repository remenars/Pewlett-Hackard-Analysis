# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the new analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title in order to prepare the company for a mass reitrement movement. We will also identify employees that are eligible for a mentorhsip program that may prepare them to fill some higher level vacancies.

## Results
* There are a total of 72,458 of possible retirees. These are employees with birthdates between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. The titles vary as shown in the following diagram:

* There are many Senior level engineers and staff that are departing. It might be best to promote from within but we will mostly have to look outside for hiring.
* The menotrship program might be able to help with the mass exodus of retirees but it will definitley not be enough
* I also ran a query to get the counts of current employees. It looks like there are a significant number of current employees with either a title of Engineer or Staff that could be promoted to the senior level. It might be easier to replace those employees instead of the senior level ones. Please see the following results:

## Summary

In summary, there are quite a number of roles that will need to be filled as our older employees retire. We may want to look at expanding the mentorship program to include more employees than just those born in the year 1965. I have updated the query to look at those born between 1956 and 1965. Expanding this to include more employees may help fill the gap and there are still enough senior employees available to mentor everyone.
